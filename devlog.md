Status Update 14/11/19

*Have done brainstorming. Many ideas came to mind. At first I wanted to do a basketball scoring app, a full service beauty salon, a food ordering system but I found this to be time consuming as we have limited time to do this. Therefore I have decided to do a niche to cater a self ordering massage service. 
 
*Decided to build my assignment on self ordering application for a Massage Service and called this application " Zen Sanctuary"

*Have started coding and the app is designed for customers to guide them through an ordering process for their treatment. This helps the customer by not having to line up and wait to be served. If they know what they want they can order ahead and just sit back and relax until called to their room.
