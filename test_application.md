####TESTING METHODS SAVE_TO_FILE

I tested one of me methods in testzen.rb 
It is meant to test the number of bytes it returns after all selections.
First i manually counted how many bytes for selecting the following add ons in my array; facial and cupping and total for the bytes after running the application should be 77
after running test if output is 77 bytes then the test is true and it works
If it does not return 77 bytes it should output false.
